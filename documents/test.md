# <u>Introduction</u>

#### The Dawnstar Fundamentals:

![](images\constant.png?msec=1649119658283)![](images\element.png?msec=1649119658286)![](images\will.png?msec=1649119658367)![](images\vibrance.png?msec=1649119658367)![](images\peace.png?msec=1649119658371)![](images\power.png?msec=1649119658376)

- These are the symbols corresponding to the Dawnstar Fundamentals, listed here in their normal order, corresponding to a clockwise reading of the triangle. Starting at Constant, followed by Element, then Will and Vibrance, then Peace and Power.

- Each Fundamental is essential to the nature of qualities, as in, they are the essence of properties we experience in our plane, the reality plane. Their essences are as follows.
  
  - ![](images\constant.png?msec=1649119658283)Constant is the essence of **Death**, the **Permanent** and the **Certain**.
  
  - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qigdfFDqQ9JcoRjonR2NNfQLNfGCKGkXlvwdWtKDraua4_96Sqow0kL7a-WMOZa12w4ueY9vqtIHugjFOgZVuwJekCnFHRI-OLGLz3pj2Az3bf14RWriGWBauvybiGbdNG91EDNw)Element is the essence of the **Physical**, **Resistance**, and **Structure**.
  
  - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DpcSqV4xbVldrH7_raM2qmaVXCKVHje2e_v69qEJFfHWO7dVN0YrdE8erycIlgSMW0mkkW_vsjLCfT6RztuzMr05mZU08tYaNiBLUDQBSlI2CrX1qt00vFrk48K2u4dR4h8KMCxE)Will is the essence of **Action**. **Knowledge**, and **Freedom**.
  
  - ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PO0WyXLNcPy0vov3JrBRTJzk-WvVkqDh59CZyXPegqPnuqpkYxpALtFuw_ZYVFE6aDwWrxWwd83t8QlraEji7GY9OvXRt3wmdAcaieJ5t5s9O4hGjYhsbFXmpay0uyEJg74GbDwV)Vibrance is the essence of **Life**. **Growth**, and **Uncertainty**.

- Dawnstar Fundamentals should be understood more as Guiding Essences for properties of objects in the Dawning Process.

- Dawnstar Fundamentals originate from the Sun.

#### The Structure of Existence:

- So, if the Dawnstar Fundamentals are to be understood as mediating essences, what are they mediating between? The answer is that they mediate between our plane, the Reality Plane, and the plane of Minds, the Ethereal Plane.
  
  ![](images\realityplane.png?msec=1649119658211?msec=1649119760022)![](images\body.png?msec=1649119658214?msec=1649119760023)![](images\mind.png?msec=1649119658218?msec=1649119760024)![](images\link.png?msec=1649119658216?msec=1649119760025)![](images\etherealplane.png?msec=1649119658221?msec=1649119760025)

- These are the symbols correlating to the Structure of Existence, in order they denote The Real Plane, Bodies, Links, Minds, and the Ethereal Plane. They are shown in this order to establish that the Reality Plane is the Plane of Bodies, the Ethereal Plane is the Plane of Minds, and Links are the Inbetween. So, what are Bodies/Minds/Links and the Planes?
  
  - ![](images\realityplane.png?msec=1649119658211?msec=1649119760022)The Reality Plane, this is the plane which is inhabited by you, and all things you're familiar with, in simple terms, it is the plane of real, physical objects and things. The Plane of Bodies.
  
  - ![](images\etherealplane.png?msec=1649119658221?msec=1649119760025)The Ethereal Plane, likewise this is the plane which is not inhabited by you or physical things, but rather inhabited by the properties and qualities of things, referred to as Minds.
  
  - ![](images\body.png?msec=1649119658214?msec=1649119760023)Body, as we've already covered, Bodies make up Physical things, chairs/limbs/land et cetera.. Namely bodies are important in that they are half of the Link, the Link being the most important idea in dawning. What the Body is to begin with will influence how close it is to it's natural Mind, which can make using specific objects a shortcut to getting properties you need (i.e, a sword will remain sharp when Dawned, so you need not spend symbols making it so. Or more advanced, a Crossbow with "Generate Element" will know to generate an arrow or similar, easier than a piece of Vystal will)
  
  - ![](images\link.png?msec=1649119658216?msec=1649119760025)Mind, the mind is the object of the Ethereal Plane, the mind can be understood as the properties and qualities of our plane, though in their Pure form, more or less. Minds are what you are trying to access when performing dawning. In Dawning your goal is to create a Link between the Body you are Dawning and the Minds you desire it to possess, while preventing it from getting Minds you didn't desire.
  
  - ![](images\mind.png?msec=1649119658218?msec=1649119760024)Link, the Link is not a very hard set concept, but effectively, it is the Dawned object, the Dawnstar fundamentals, the symbols and the relationship between Minds and Bodies. The link is the mediator between objects and their properties, deciding what minds can come through to our reality plane, and what bodies can go through to the ethereal plane. The Link is what's used to initiate dawning, as it allows Vish to flow through the Ethereal Plane and come back out into the Body. Then the Link is also the point of Action, the Dawned object will use as an output. It is also the Dawned Object itself. The Link should be understood as all of this conceptually, but also as merely it's symbol.
  
  **Notes on Dawning Bodies**

- All natural objects are technically a dawned object, as all things have a Body and a Mind, a physical form and properties. Though we call such normal things "rudimentary objects" since they are of a simple nature, usually their link consists merely of the Dawnstar Fundamental "Element" or another Fundamental, as their Mind and Body are equally simple. Rudimentary Objects make up nearly all of the bodies one might encounter.

- Dawned Objects themselves can however be used as Bodies in the Dawning process, though if you don't know what you're doing (or if you do for that matter) this can be very volatile, or just inneffective.

- Multiple Bodies can be used in the dawning process, either to transfer vish and fundamentals a greater distance or to create a dawned object composed of many parts. To do this one can either attempt to force the Vish and Fundamentals through the Ethereal Plane and into a Link symbol bestowed to each Body, or they can lay physical trails of Vish one way or another, then use those to directly infuse it.

#### Vish: The Essence of Being

![](images\Vish.png?msec=1649119658244?msec=1649450688049)![](images\vystal.png?msec=1649119658246?msec=1649450688050)![](images\vishrune.png?msec=1649119658248?msec=1649450688050)

- Above are the symbols correlating to Vish, Vystal, and Dawnstone. The three forms of Vish energy. Or, the essence of Being.

- ![](images\Vish.png?msec=1649119658244?msec=1649450688049)Vish, the lifeblood of control and existence. The fundamental energy of being. A fluid like form of congealed being, which drives the existence of Dawned Objects, where the Dawnstar Fundamentals are the Fundamental *essences* of properties, the properties themselves without essence are made of Vish, as are all other things except the Dawnstar Fundamentals.
  
  **<u>Vish and Dawning</u>**
  
  - In Dawning Vish is the energy used to bring the Dawned Object into existence, Symbols on Vish act like obfuscations in a metaphorical window between the two planes. Then the Dawnstar Fundamentals shine through this obfuscated window and cast shadows. Those shadows are properties, then due to Vish forcing existence, those Properties must then link to a Body to stick around. Vish then maintains this Dawned Object's Being.
  
  - So in short Vish's role in Dawning is as the energy sustaining the link, and the Symbols, which allow Dawning to happen. Then the Startype fundamentals are what go into giving those pure Vish properties Essence, and sustain anything regarding themselves, such as the use of Power merely to boost a Dawned Object.
  
  - Natural objects are believed to have something akin to the Dawning symbols within the Ethereal Plane, which cause objects to Link the same way our Dawning symbols cause properties to Link.
  
  - As an energy form, Vish is capable of traversal throughout both Planes. Meaning it can be transmitted through a Link, energetic Vish can also transmit through liquid Vish. The change between energetic and liquid Vish is hapless, Vish is treated as both it's liquid and energy forms, though it is practically used in it's liquid blood form to make lines to transmit energetic Vish along.
  
  - Liquid Vish is the Blood found in all living creatures, though in blood there are impurities.

- ![](images\vystal.png?msec=1649119658246?msec=1649450688050)Vystal, While Vish is both like a fluid and an energy at once, Vystal is a bona fide chalk like Crystal, it is used in nearly all Dawning to write symbols.
  
  - It can also be used by carving symbols into it if you wish for the Vystal to serve as a body. Sometimes this is preferred for instance as modules to be added or removed to and from something. Vystal is obtained through the expert Dawning of frozen congealed liquid Vish.
  
  - Vystal will eventually fade away, or get washed away, though this is easier said than done. It also slowly decays on it's own if no energetic Vish goes through it.

- ![](images\vishrune.png?msec=1649119658248?msec=1649450688050)Dawnstone, An ultrahard version of Vystal, it cannot be used like Chalk, but bears no risk of fading away or breaking as Vystal does. Furthermore Dawnstone being made of such an intense concentration of Vish allows all that is written on it to come pre-charged with great amounts of energy. Finally Dawnstone possesses illusive and powerful abilities, such as linking without a link, and dawning the higher symbols.
  
  - Dawnstone is typically only found in the Dawned Organs of Living Creatures.
  
  - Humans have 9 pieces of Dawnstone naturally, 6 within their Core Of Humanity, and 3 others. One below their neck in the top of the chest, etched into it is the symbol for Spirit. One in their head, etched into that the symbol for Thought. Then a final one in the lower gut, etched into that is the symbol for Animate. The rest of human bodies are natural objects.
  
  - Symbols can not be cleared from used Dawnstone, though there are Dawned Objects which can clear a used dawnstone for re-use.

#### The Core of Humanity

 ![](images\coreofhumanity.png?msec=1649119658388?msec=1649444615603) ![](images\omni.png?msec=1649119658382)![](images\amne.png?msec=1649119658379)

Above are the symbols correlating to the Core of Humanity, followed by Omnian, and Amnean. These are the Fundamentals of our ability to perform Dawning.

- ![](images\coreofhumanity.png?msec=1649119658388?msec=1649444615603) The Core of Humanity. This represents the stonelike organ in the centre of all creatures, especially humans. It is made of 6 pieces, each one a piece of Dawnstone with one of the Dawnstar Fundamentals etched into it. Each piece is quite thick and on the other side are etched in the Symbols Amnean and Omnian alternated randomly for each person. Then the back of each slice has etched in the symbol for Vish.
  
  - The Core of Humanity is what allows humans to store Vish and Dawnstar Fundamentals within themselves and redistribute them throughout their body, all creatures have one though Humans are the only creature bestowed with all 6 Fundamentals.
  - Though in order to be able to perform remote dawning, by forcing Vish and Dawnstar Fundamentals into the Ethereal Plane and out the link of an object, one must find a way to etch the symbol for Link into their Core.

![](images\omni.png?msec=1649119658382)Omnian, the true fundamental.

![](images\amne.png?msec=1649119658379)Amnean, anti omnian.

#### The Dawnstar Mixtures

- These are the Fundamental Mixtures, much like the Dawnstar Fundamentals these are mediating essences for Linking Bodies and Minds, these are used much like the Dawnstar Fundamentals, though their essences are not as Vague. Their names and what is required to make them are good clues into how they ought to be used as Essences.

- You can write the symbols correlating to these as a short hand for writing them, though be weary you can accidently create them by writing what creates them together, though those must be written in the order destribed here.

## <u>The High Symbols</u>

- The high symbols are the symbols at the edges of the triangle. Save for 3 mixes.
  
  - High Symbols are unique, chaotic, and powerful symbols. Only of use upon clean Dawnstone.

#### Mancia: Order Life & Death

Life is Mysterious, although Cycle, Thought, Animate, Vibrance, etc.. are all life related essences, once life has really gotten going it brings forth a sort of chaos which can be difficult to restrain, in a way that can be considered to be the job of the Mancia symbols.

![](images\vibromancy.png?msec=1649119658236?msec=1649617527729)![](images\animancy.png?msec=1649119658239?msec=1649617527729)![](images\vegemancy.png?msec=1649119658237?msec=1649617527729)![](images\necromancy.png?msec=1649119658242?msec=1649617527729)![](images\constimancy.png?msec=1649119658240?msec=1649617527729)

In order they are Vibromancy, Animancy, Vegemancy, Necromancy, and Constamancy

Each of these can be placed upon either created life or a dawned object used for the control of life in one way or another, to regulate the sort of life that creation can experience, or allow an object's properties to effect life in that way. All of this also applies to death, as the Mancia are simply a short spectrum from vibrance control to constant control.

- ![](images\vibromancy.png?msec=1649119658236?msec=1649617527729)Vibromancy, life at it's highest, energetic vibrant life. Use this if you wish to afford a birth of energetic creativity upon created life, or if you wish for life related properties of objects to control or regulate the energy of life rather than life itself.

- ![](images\animancy.png?msec=1649119658239?msec=1649617527729)Animancy, animals and other sorts of creature life.

- ![](images\vegemancy.png?msec=1649119658237?msec=1649617527729)Vegemancy, barely animate living things, plants and food.

- ![](images\necromancy.png?msec=1649119658242?msec=1649617527729)Necromancy, corpses, zombies, skeletons, the works.

- ![](images\constimancy.png?msec=1649119658240?msec=1649617527729)Constamancy, the energy of death, what drives the life of the dead, of ghosts and ghouls alike.

- The Ethereal Plane has a natural Mancia for regulating the natural cycles of the living and dead.

#### Placea: Relative Existence

![](images\descended.png?msec=1649119658222?msec=1649633476728)![](images\bound.png?msec=1649119658227?msec=1649633476729)![](images\suspended.png?msec=1649119658229?msec=1649633476729)![](images\free.png?msec=1649119658234?msec=1649633476729)![](images\ascended.png?msec=1649119658231?msec=1649633476729)

These are the placea symbols, they remark a relationship to the Planes.

They are in order, Bound, Worldly, Suspended, Voidly, Free.

Bound is completely Real, Free is completely Ethereal.

Worldly is partially real/partially suspended, Voidly is partially Ethereal partially suspended.

Suspended is a stage of transition.

These are used specifically on pieces of Dawnstone to create ethereal links between Dawned Objects as a localized way of circulating Vish or injecting Fundamentals into a community of objects. Only a very advanced Dawner must concern themselves with the Placea.

#### Natria: The Eye of the Divine

Along the way you may have come up against questions without answers, perhaps a few, perhaps many. You may have realized that they are simply not yet known, in many cases some know of them but have not shared them. But in any other case than those it is because the knowledge is known to exist through a specific mean unknown, that mean is referred to always, as Natri. The beginning, the sight. Known to some as creator, to others as mere nature. To true Dawners however, it is merely known, as the source of these unknowns. The symbols related to those unknowns are the Natrian symbols.

In order they are, Imbuement, Natri, Creation, Origin, and Nullify.

 ![](images\imbuement.png?msec=1649119658196?msec=1649617426996?msec=1649636467030) Imbuement. Known as the pure equivelant to Dawning, imbuement is the creation of Natural Dawned objects through unknown means.

![](images\natri.png?msec=1649119658200?msec=1649617426996?msec=1649636467031)Natri, the eye of the triangle of Natri, this symbol is used often to add the ability of sense to a Dawned creation, or to peer into the Future. The power of this symbol is illusive, as being a higher symbol it can only be used on Dawnstone, which is somewhat difficult to use.

![](images\creation.png?msec=1649119658203?msec=1649617426996?msec=1649636467031)Creation, in what way do the Symbols truly cast the shadows that become properties? why must that be described in such a metaphorical way? Put simply, the means by which the properties truly come into existence, why the symbols of the triangle are the only symbols known to work, or what Vish really is. All of that is known to be from the same unknown source, the Natrian symbol of Creation, used to create new properties.

![](images\genesis.png?msec=1649119658205?msec=1649617426981?msec=1649636467031)Origin. Likewise, the origin of the Dawnstar Fundamentals, the true fundamental, and the Sun, all originate from? Is unknown, but said to be sourced in the Natrian symbol of Origin. Used to create new Suns.

#### The Division of Humanity

Finally we come to the division of Humanity, the 6 high symbols on the bottom of the triangle of Natri.

in order they are the Sorcerors, the Primordians, the Manipulators, the Clergy, the Enforcers, and the Monks.

As you have probably noticed, each division in humanity corresponds to one of the Dawnstar Fundamentals.
