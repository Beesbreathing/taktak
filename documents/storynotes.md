## <u>Division Information</u>

### General Ranks

- In General, Divisions have 4 main ranks, then each have their own special jobs as well.

- These ranks are the Natural Dawners, with 6 of the same type of fundamental on their core. They sit at the top unless stated otherwise. Following them are True Dawners, who have had Dawnstone imbedded in them to gain the rank. After that are Daybringers and Apprentices.

- The Voyagers send delegates to convene with Natural and True Dawners, never anyone lower, the nature of the Voyager's delegates is not well documented, only those at the top even really know who they are.

- Voyagers will send delegates of the 3 Fundamental Mixtures, depending on the sect. For **Sorcerors** and **Primordians** they send **Delegates of Decay**, for **Manipulators** and **Clergy** they send **Delegates of Animation**, then for **Monks** and **Enforcers** they send **Delegates of Shields**.

- Some special jobs in sects include Captains for the Enforcers, *etc..*

### Gear and Weaponry

- Sorcerors:
  
  - Will typically weild staffs of a complex nature, able to do a specific powerful action. Such as a: **"Generate Animate Energy" - "Force Focus" - "Vish Link Will Decay" - "Generate Power Energy Element"** = Create a flying bit of energy, sped up with Force and straightened with Focus, give it a 'Vish Link' to Will it's Decay remotely by adding Vish, then when it decays it'll Generate the Powerful Energy Element, i.e, an Explosion.. The vish link could be improved with Placea if Dawnstone were available, so that it'd be more difficult for enemies to detonate it themselves.
