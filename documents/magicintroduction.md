### INTRODUCTION TO DAWNING

*On minds, bodies, links, dawnstar reagents, vish, and objects.*

Dawning is the act of using Vystal chalk to write symbols denoting the Dawnstar Reagents, as well as other symbols from the Natrian Pyramid. All in order to “Dawn” an object, by providing it with a Link, and essences for properties, and then awakening it with Vish and your own Dawnstar Reagents through the Link, in order to create a Dawned object. 

A Dawned object is an object which has been given special properties through this process.

An object without special properties is known as a rudimentary object.

Rudimentary Objects usually make up what is called the Body, the Body is any object of the Reality Plane which is used in Dawning, the Reality Plane is where You, and other physical things reside. 

The Body is what these symbols are drawn onto. When the Link is drawn and you begin attempting to feed in Vish and Dawnstar Reagents through your own Link to activate the object, the Body will connect with a Mind in the Ethereal plane in order to receive the Vish. This connecting of the Body and Mind are why we call it a Link.

Minds are the objects of the Ethereal Plane, though you can think of them like the source of the properties of objects in our plane. When Dawning an object, the Mind it connects too will essentially read the symbols on the object to try and figure out what kind of object it’s becoming the Mind for. This is why we call the Dawnstar Reagents the “essences of properties” as they are the main things which react with the Mind to alter it’s perception of the kind of object it’s going into. Changing which properties the Mind will send through the Link.

It is during this process of the Mind connecting with the Body through the Link that you shall attempt willing the properties how you see fit.

It will be guided in what properties to send by the symbols present, but if you wish for it to obtain more specific properties. Then the symbols alone will not be enough. Knowing how much Vish and how much of which reagents to feed, and knowing how to Will an object’s properties as you see fit, are the Skills of Dawning.

The amount of Will you have in your Core will benefit your ability to will these properties. Though beyond that, practice is what’s required.

If the Vish finds somewhere else to go instead of the object, it will go there instead. Be sure that the object for Dawning is as close to the Vish and reagent source as you can make it, or connected to an object which is, via Vusion.

Vish must go somewhere when you feed it through your own Link, it is not advisable to do this when there is not an object to be Dawned present, as you may not know where the Vish will end up, and this can be disastrous. An exception to this being objects which are activated by Vish.

Rudimentary objects typically don’t possess anything special in regards to Dawning, though they can have inherent Dawnstar Reagents, for most-all things this will just be Element. 

Other Dawned objects can be used as a Body if you dont want to use a rudimentary object, though it is not advisable to do this if you do not know what you are doing.

### Dawnstar Reagents

Each reagent has specific qualities which guide the properties for which it becomes the essence. Those are summarized as follows.

On you they are stored in your core of Natri.
